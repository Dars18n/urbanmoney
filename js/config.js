  /* ---------- FAQs ---------- */
  faqs: [
    { q: "Is your service free for customers?",
      a: "Our advisory and comparison service is free for customers. Lenders may charge their own processing fees, which we explain clearly before you apply." },
    { q: "How fast can my loan be sanctioned?",
      a: "It depends on the loan type and lender. Personal loans can be sanctioned within a few working days once documents are complete; home loans and LAP usually take longer because of legal and technical property checks." },
    { q: "What CIBIL score do I need?",
      a: "Most lenders prefer a score of 700 or above, and 750+ usually gets better rates. If your score is lower, we can still suggest lenders and steps to improve your eligibility." },
    { q: "What can I use a Loan Against Property for?",
      a: "Almost any genuine need – business expansion, working capital, children's education, medical expenses, a family wedding or consolidating costlier debt. Because your property is the security, LAP usually comes at a lower rate than an unsecured loan." },
    { q: "Do I need to visit the office?",
      a: "No. We offer doorstep document pickup across Pune and can handle most of the process over phone and WhatsApp. You're welcome to visit us at Deccan Gymkhana anytime during working hours." },
    { q: "Is my personal data safe?",
      a: "Your details are used only to process your enquiry and are shared only with partner lenders you choose to apply with. See our Privacy Policy for details." }
